                    I was completely ignoring the facts that were sitting in a corner of dismay at the edge of my mind. Focused on the beauty surrounding the outside ignoring the ugly within.
                    
                    It’s fucked though. Why so, does that matter. You hope and pray there will come a day when they will tear that facade away.
                    
                    That day doesn’t come, so we string along. Holding on by a god damn thread. For what to be blamed for the lack of support of a religious cult.

                    Therefore we said goodbye, while I’m sitting here drowning in unconditional love for others the rest of the world has conditions. I’ll learn to not carry my heart & soul on my sleeve.
